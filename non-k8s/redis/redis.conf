# Read metrics from one or many redis servers
[[inputs.redis]]
  ## specify servers via a url matching:
  ##  [protocol://][:password]@address[:port]
  ##  e.g.
  ##    tcp://localhost:6379
  ##    tcp://:password@192.168.99.100
  ##    unix:///var/run/redis.sock

  ## If no servers are specified, then localhost is used as the host.
  ## If no port is specified, 6379 is used

# A plugin that can send metrics to Sumo Logic HTTP metric collector.
[[outputs.sumologic]]
  ## Unique URL generated for your HTTP Metrics Source.
  ## This is the address to send metrics to.
  url = "https://events.sumologic.net/receiver/v1/http/<UniqueHTTPCollectorCode>"

  ## Data format to be used for sending metrics.
  ## This will set the "Content-Type" header accordingly.
  ## Currently supported formats:
  ## * graphite - for Content-Type of application/vnd.sumologic.graphite
  ## * carbon2 - for Content-Type of application/vnd.sumologic.carbon2
  ## * prometheus - for Content-Type of application/vnd.sumologic.prometheus

  ## https://help.sumologic.com/03Send-Data/Sources/02Sources-for-Hosted-Collectors/HTTP-Source/Upload-Metrics-to-an-HTTP-Source#content-type-headers-for-metrics
  ##
  ## NOTE:
  ## When unset, telegraf will by default use the influx serializer which is currently unsupported
  ## in HTTP Source.
  data_format = "prometheus"

  ## Timeout used for HTTP request
  # timeout = "5s"
  
  ## Max HTTP request body size in bytes before compression (if applied).
  ## By default 1MB is recommended.
  ## NOTE:
  ## Bear in mind that in some serializer a metric even though serialized to multiple
  ## lines cannot be split any further so setting this very low might not work
  ## as expected.
  # max_request_body_size = 1000000
